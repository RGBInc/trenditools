## ✅ Migration Completed

The documentation reorganization has been successfully implemented! All files have been moved to their appropriate directories and the new structure is now active.

### What Was Done
1. ✅ Created organized directory structure with 5 main sections
2. ✅ Created comprehensive README files for each section
3. ✅ Moved all documentation files to appropriate directories
4. ✅ Updated main docs README with new navigation and quick start paths
5. ✅ Maintained all existing content while improving organization

### Next Steps
- Update any external references to moved files
- Consider adding redirects if needed for commonly accessed files

- Monitor usage and adjust organization as needed

### Maintenance
- Use the documentation update checklist in the main README
- Keep section READMEs updated as new files are added
- Follow the established patterns for new documentation

## 📝 README Templates

Each folder should have a README.md that:
- Explains the purpose of the folder
- Lists all documents with brief descriptions
- Provides quick navigation to related sections
- Includes common use cases and workflows

## 🔗 Cross-References

Documents should reference related content:
- Architecture docs link to deployment guides
- Feature docs link to user flows
- Security docs reference all relevant sections
- Processing docs link to architecture explanations

This organization makes the TrendiTools documentation more accessible, maintainable, and user-friendly while preserving all existing content.
