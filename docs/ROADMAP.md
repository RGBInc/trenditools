## Technical Implementation Notes

### Vector Search with Convex
```typescript
// Future implementation example
export const vectorSearch = query({
  args: { 
    query: v.string(),
    limit: v.optional(v.number()),
  },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    // Generate embedding for search query
    const queryEmbedding = await generateEmbedding(args.query);
    
    // Perform vector search
    const results = await ctx.vectorSearch("tools", "embedding", {
      vector: queryEmbedding,
      limit: args.limit || 10,
    });
    
    return results;
  },
});
```

### AI Integration Architecture
- **Embedding Generation**: Use OpenAI or similar for tool description embeddings
- **Semantic Search**: Combine vector search with traditional full-text search
- **Recommendation Engine**: Collaborative filtering + content-based recommendations
- **Natural Language Processing**: Intent recognition and query understanding
